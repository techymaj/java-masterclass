# My Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my Java Learning Repository! ðŸš€ This repository serves as a documentation of my journey as I dive into the world of Java programming.

## About Me

## Learning Goals

My main goals for learning Java include:

- Building a solid understanding of the basics.
- Mastering object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
- Exploring advanced topics such as exception handling and collections.
- Creating practical projects to apply my knowledge.
