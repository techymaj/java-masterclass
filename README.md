# My Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my Java Learning Repository! ðŸš€ This repository serves as a documentation of my journey as I dive into the world of Java programming.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Majaliwa M. Wilfried, and I'm passionate about learning Java. I've started this repository to keep track of what I learn, share my progress, and hopefully help others on their learning journeys.

## Learning Goals

My main goals for learning Java include:

- Building a solid understanding of the basics.
- Mastering object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
- Exploring advanced topics such as exception handling and collections.
- Creating practical projects to apply my knowledge.

## Repository Structure

### [Initializer Blocks](https://github.com/techymaj/java-masterclass/blob/main/TheMainMethod/src/Main.java)
- **What I learned:** You can use initializers to execute code when the class is loaded in memory or when an object is created from that class

## Projects

To be tabled after I'm done with the course

## Contributions

I'm open to feedback and suggestions. If you have insights or corrections, feel free to open an issue or send a pull request.

Happy coding! ðŸŒŸ
